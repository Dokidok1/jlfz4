1.introduction
  In this project, we will work as an front-end mix skill group and develop the system which retrive data from augur system into 
  web and make it visible as chart or diagram, such as the top commit contributor in each repository and the total commits number 
  she/he made instead of just showing the data, provide users the logical and easy-access interface is equally important as the
  accurate data from augur.

2.Software Production Overview
  it s a web interface allow user interact with augur data
  
  
  
3.System Use
  For the clients, this system will be used to provided them the data and chart retreived from augur, in the interface, users could
  also operate with the system the way they want, for example, there will be drop-down button for user to choose which category of
  intellegence they want have a look. Also, to fulfill clients' desire, we will have to take a survey to see what function supposed to
  be implemented and what kind of layout works convinient for customer to use.

use case 2: https://github.com/Dokidok1/jlfz4/blob/master/use%20case2.jpg

functional:
          retrive data from augur

 data shows in each diagram related to each repo correctly
 data keep updated
 once the data in repo updated, the chart also need be changed in time
 change the ordedr or layout based on the latest updated data 
 able to user open several tabs for the interface in same browser



6.Purchased Components
